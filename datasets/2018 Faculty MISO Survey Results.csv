I reported this a number of times during the fall semester.

If that does not work and you cannot access your email, then how are you supposed to report an issue?  Especially if it is after hours when no one is answering the phone at the helpdesk. /  / 3.

Both my scholarly work and my teaching would be greatly enhanced if I had access to a small server or computer cluster for performing processor-intensive projects.  /  / I currently use my campus-issued laptop for such scholarship-related projects, but processor jobs can take upwards of 12 hours, during which I am unable to use my laptop for other purposes. A dedicated server would allow me to submit jobs that run in the background over longer periods of time.  /  / For student instruction, I currently have students install software on their own laptops. This tends to be problematic due to the large variability in student laptop performance/specs, which leads to a large variability in how the installs are performed. Typically, most students don't have the requisite experience to do the installations entirely on their own, so the process has become quite labor intensive on myself. If students could complete projects on a remote server, this would save a great deal of time. Additionally, it would give students a better feel for how such projects are completed in the real world.  /  / I have discussed the idea of sharing a server with several faculty members on campus from different colleges, but we all agree that we do not have the time or requisite skill set to manage such a resource.

One of the biggest challenges is the use of part-time student workers that are NOT experts in IT but are used so that FSU can save money. Laying off full-time qualified IT help and replacing with part-time student workers is a significant mistake that diminishes the professionalism of IT. The student workers are nice but rarely can fix the issue and have to get assistance which makes the interaction take way too long!

The Minuteman network is not primarily academic, and does not serve the institution's mission well at all. More emphasis and resources also need to be placed on building a quality academic physical library collection, and expanding its volume. This move towards thinking of the library as a social space or simply a quiet place to study is misguided. I sometimes get the impression that the library staff are more interested in purging the physical collection of perceived non-useful items than growing it. And the primary purpose of the purging appears to be Library staff wanting to make sure more space isn't taken up by books (creating space for new additions to the collections seems only to be secondary goal), which is a totally unacceptable viewpoint if true. Reference staff in the library are friendly and responsive, but I have seen in other academic libraries reference staff who are much more competent and highly trained to help academic researchers (students and faculty). The new Blackboard seems if anything to be a regression, not an improvement, from the old Blackboard, which was problematic enough."
