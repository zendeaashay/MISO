No matter where you are, there are often people talking too loud, placing music, etc, and nobody to enforce any noise policies. It is difficult to approach a group of 10 people as well when you are by yourself. There is not nearly enough group working space as there should be (only two rooms). Perhaps a few classrooms should remain unlocked for those looking to do group work so the rest of the library is not hindered. The hours also do not reflect the needs of college students. Although it is nice to have the library open later during finals week, 1am is just not realistic for students demands.  /  / Also, I dont think this survey is about this but the cinderblock would like 10x better with a coat of paint.

We're not asking for a gaming PC, we're asking for Microsoft Word to load in less than a minute. But this ""problem"" is minor at best. The real issue is below. /  / Second, I realize that security is important, but there are other things that are important, such as FUN! A smart TV is fun, a gaming console is fun, but you and I clearly know that most these devices DO NOT support the WPA2+EAP/PEAP security type that FSU_Wireless has. Then to add salt to injury, connecting to FSU_Guest requires your MAC adress or register your device every three days.  /  / So instead of getting rid of fsu_wifi, (which is still here, because you guys know you f*cked up and some of your devices won't be able to connect to FSU_Wireless or FSU_Guest, and oh my god let's not get started on eduroam...That sh*t does not work) maybe we should've kept some of it's access points in the dorms so that our devices can connect easily. This way, someone at IT will not have to manually input everyone's MAC address, (and I hope you gave this person a raise because that's extra responsibility) and students will be more satisfied. While this isn't really an academic reason, based on what I've experienced so far, it would boost student's morale and people will feel like the school is ACTUALLY listening to them, because I've probably heard more than 20 people complain about this very situation this week alone.
